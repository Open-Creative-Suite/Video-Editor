**Video Editor** is part of **Open Creative Suite**—a free and open-source alternative to Adobe Creative Suite, designed for creative professionals.

**Project Vision:**  
The goal is to make Video Editor instantly familiar to users of Adobe Premiere Pro, so creative professionals can switch without having to relearn workflows. The long-term milestone is for all Open Creative Suite apps to work together as a seamless ecosystem.

Many FOSS creative projects have dated UI/UX and lack true integration. My aim is to build a modern, intuitive experience and a real ecosystem where apps from this suite and other projects can work together seamlessly.

- **No AI, no bloatware:** 100% FOSS, focused on creative freedom and performance.
- **For professionals:** Intuitive, powerful, and ready for real-world creative work.
- **Ecosystem-first:** Designed for seamless integration with other apps, including third-party FOSS tools.


## **A Call for Developers and Designers:**  
I am not a developer or a UI/UX designer, just someone fed up with Adobe and the lack of a true FOSS alternative. If you’re passionate about open-source, design, or development, your help is needed to make this vision a reality. All contributions are welcome!

**How to Get Involved:**
- Star and watch this repo to follow progress.
- Check out the issues for ways to help.
- Open a discussion if you have ideas or questions.
- See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.

*Video Editor is just one app in Open Creative Suite. If you’re interested in helping with other apps (vector design, desktop publishing, etc.), please reach out or check the other repositories!*
