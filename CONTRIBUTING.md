# Contributing to Video Editor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Video Editor**, part of the Open Creative Suite!

**This project is in its very early stages.**  
Right now, the repository only contains a README and a GPL-3.0 license. There is no codebase yet—this is a call for help to get things started!

## How You Can Help

- **Developers:** Help start the codebase, suggest architecture, or set up the initial project structure.
- **UI/UX Designers:** Propose interface mockups, user flows, or design guidelines.
- **Writers:** Help draft documentation, vision statements, or onboarding guides.
- **Anyone:** Share ideas, feedback, or just encouragement!

## Getting Started

1. **Open an Issue or Discussion:**  
   Share your ideas, suggestions, or questions. Let’s plan the first steps together!

2. **Propose a Project Structure:**  
   If you have experience with similar apps, suggest how to organize the codebase or which technologies to use.

3. **Design Mockups:**  
   If you’re a designer, share interface ideas or workflow diagrams.

4. **Spread the Word:**  
   Star the repo, share it with others, or invite collaborators.
